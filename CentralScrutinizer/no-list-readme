The no-list branch is specifically for the Central Scrutinizer. 
At present the CS keeps a list of all the terminals. The list gets big fast and blows out its memory. 
But the sim has a list of terminals. 
When the CS needs terminals, it should request them to respond, preferably with a filter string. 
Only terminals that match the filter string will respond. 
For example, 
type:door location:cellblock-blue
type:terminal location:main
They then return their IDs, which the CS can then store in a list of whatever. 
If the CS needs to activate a terminal, it sends the terminal's identifier 
and it repsonds with parameters such as eye coordinates. 
The goal is to store no persistent information about terminals in the CS. 

Installation
Central Scrutinizer gets
CentralScrutinizer.lsl
debug.lsl
interference.lsl

Both kinds of terminals get 
terminal.lsl

Sci Fi Desk gets
terminalScifiDesk.lsl

debugLogger.lsl and messageLogger.lsl are simple ugly floaty-text loggers.
