The no-list branch is specifically for the Central Scrutinizer. 
At present the CS keeps a list of all the terminals. The list gets big fast and blows out its memory. 
But the sim has a list of terminals. 
When the CS needs terminals, it should request them to respond, preferably with a filter string. 
Only terminals that match the filter string will respond. 
For example, 
type:door location:cellblock-blue
type:terminal location:main
They then return their IDs, which the CS can then store in a list of whatever. 
If the CS needs to activate a terminal, it sends the terminal's identifier 
and it repsonds with parameters such as eye coordinates. 
The goal is to store no persistent information about terminals in the CS.
