Welcome to Warden AI News. 
When I make significant changes to the Warden system, I'll write about it here. I'll issue a new date on this document every time.

---------------------------------
The MRI Scanner in Medical has a command-line interface under development. 
When you issue the command /2 register medical, you will see
Central Scrutinizer: INFO: registered "Central Scrutinizer Terminal 15f6" at 15f6; Medical Scanner
Send it commands like /2 15f6 on
The commands it knows are on off reset maint stow ready load scan unload stop. 
It's a bit finnicky and it doesn't yet report back its state properly. 
The interface script will become the basis of other interfaced devices.

---------------------------------
You must "/2 register" before you can activate terminals in an area
Areas are Main, Medical, Mechanics, Cellblock.

Once an area's terminals are registered, you can activate a terminal directly
by typing its registration like "/2 13f3". 
 

20181231 Warden AI News
-------------------------------
The "register" command now takes a parameter: a filter term for what section of the station you want to monitor. 
Every terminal or device should have a description filled in; Standards for writing descriptions will be written. 
For example, /2 register main or /2 register cellblock.
If you leave the filter off, it becomes /2 register default. 
At least one terminal should have "default" in its description. 

The result of this is that the number of terminals easily accessible at any one time is reduced,
but now they won't overflow memory, so more devices can be deployed. 
Since there are so many cells, when cells become devices, their names will have to inherently limit registrations. 

This is a bit of a kludge on the existing system, as the Central Scrutinizer still maintains a list of devices. 
Early calculations show that each device costs about 300 bytes and there's memory for about 40 devices. 

Debug and Interference modules have been isolated into separate scripts. 
It will take careful examination of the code to see what more can be extracted into separate modules 
to free up more memory in the script that maintains the terminal list.

-------------------------------
The Warden AI project will be undergoing major architectural revision. 
See https://github.com/timberwoof/Black-Gazza/tree/master/CentralScrutinizer
see branch no-list for code. 
The Warden in this room will use a different channel.

• The Shout command has been removed because it was abused. When you're RPing the AI, don't be an ass. IF you abuse the AI system, then you ruin the fun for everyone.

• Integration with the High Security Cells
The nearby terminal is 8f18. 
The controller designator is 7h17. 
The basic commands available are
/2 open 7h17 3
/2 close 7h17 4
where that number on the end is the number of the cell. 
Cells are numbered 1-6. 
Open lowers the plunger so the inmate can get in or out.
CLose raises the plunger to seal the inmate in. 

When someone goes into a cell, you are notified: 
[11:56]  HighSecurityCell 7h17: High Security Cell 7h17 4 is occupied,Timberwoof Lupindo

Here are premade commands you can copy and paste into text
/2 open 7h17 1
/2 open 7h17 2
/2 open 7h17 3
/2 open 7h17 4
/2 open 7h17 5
/2 open 7h17 6

/2 close 7h17 1
/2 close 7h17 2
/2 close 7h17 3
/2 close 7h17 4
/2 close 7h17 5
/2 close 7h17 6

-------------------------
• Terminals no longer have floating text. Floating text is ugly. Now the terminals speak their change in status when you sit, activate a terminal, or stand. 

• I've reinstated the Zap command. It's
/2 zap,timber

Any part of the intended target's name will work. It will zap anyone whose name matches within 20 meters of the active terminal. You have to put a comma between the zap command and the target name. 
/2 zap,a
is really unfair.

• Integration with the Medical mental Ward Cells
The nearby terminal is 163e13. 
The designator is 14e13. 
The basic commands available are
/2 open 14e13 3
/2 close 14e13 4
/2 who 14e13 5
where that number on the end is the number of the cell. 
Cells are numbered 1-5. 
Open opens the door so the inmate can get in or out. 
Close closes the door to seal them in. 
Who tells you who's inside. 

You can set the size of a cell to Small, Medium or Large: 
/2 Small 14e13 5

You can set the inside texture of a cell to Rubber, Canvas, Pink, Paws, or Old
/2 Rubber 14e13 1
The commands for the Mental Ward Cells are case-sensitive. 

When someone goes into a cell, you are notified: 
[11:56]  MentalWardCells 13e13: Mental Ward Cell 13e13 4 is occupied,Timberwoof Lupindo

Here are some premade commands you can copy and paste into chat. 
/2 open 14e13 1
/2 open 14e13 2

/2 large 14e13 2
/2 large 14e13 3
/2 large 14e13 4
/2 large 14e13 5

As AI you have access to all the textures in the cells, including some that are not present on the operator's menu. 
rubber - shiny black latex
canvas - classic mental hospital padded cell
paws - tacky cute pawprints
pink - shiny pink latex
old - grungy, mmismatched mental hospital padded cell

steel - steel plates and rivets
glass - transparent to the carpeted walls of the pod. 
stars - My god, it's full of stars!
white - cold white tile
opt2 - creepy moving optical illusion
opt3 - creepy moving optical illusion
opt5 - creepy moving optical illusion

Note: The Medical staff perfer using the first set as these are "padded" and thus safe for the inmates. 
The others are mean and cold and clammy and crazy-inducing. 

• Ground station
-110 is the designator for the ground station. 

• Scan
/2 scan lets you look at the whole station in sequence. 
/2 scan Main lets you look at all the terminals on the Main decks. 
/2 scan Medical lets you look at all the terminals on the Medical decks. 
/2 scan Cellblock lets you look at all the terminals on the Cellblock decks. 

/2 stop 
to stop the scan

---------------------------
• New Command:
shout

/2 shout * Number Five is alive!
/2 shout Main Number Five is alive!

The first word after the shout command is the filter.
* sends the message to all terminals. 
"Main" for example sends the message to all terminals that have "Main" in their name or description. 
This cycles through them one at a time so if you send a message to * it may take a few seconds to get everywhere. 


• No More Cells. 
The cells are tricky and problematic to control, and they take up a huge amount of memory given what they can do, so I short-circuit registering them. They no longer appear in the devices list and you cannot control them. 

During normal operations, the script creates and destroys temporary variables. They go in the same place as the list of terminals, and all of that is limited to 64 kB. If it goes over 64kB, it dies. I hope that not listing the terminals will eliminate the random crashes the AI has been suffering. 

The plan is to make blocks of cells that are controlled from a central terminal. And if I'm clever, a cellb-lock controller is also a Warden terminal at the same time. 


• Debug works differently. 
Every message goes through the debug system. 
/2 debug 0 - normal operations 
/2 debug 1 - debug
/2 debug 2 - trace (very detailed)
When you're sitting, you get all the messages through IMs. 
When no one's sitting, they get whispered at the current debug level. 
Debug levels 1 and 2 report on free memory available. You can see it drain as it registers the terminals.
