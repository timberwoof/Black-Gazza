# TWL's Transformation HUD configuration

# Introduction
# This note-card configures and explains the features of  TWL's Transformation HUD.
# Author: Timberwoof Lupindo

# The name of this note card must be "TWL's Transformation HUD configuration".
# Lines beginning with # are ignored by the HUD but take time to process, about 33 seconds. 
# Make a backup copy of this notecard. 
# Once you have the configuration how you want it, delete all the lines that begin with #. 

# The HUD uses RLV to do the transformation. RLV in the viewer must be on for it to work.
# Attach the hud. It should be white. Depending on the logging level, it will tell you its state. 
# The HUD changes images and colors depending on what it will do. 
# If it shows a werewolf, you will transform to a were.
# If it shows a statue, you will transform into stone. 
# White: starting up.
# Red: you have transformed into your were form. 
# Orange: you are transforming. 
# Yellow: Armed and ready.
# Green: tou are transformed into your flesh form. 
# Blue: you have transformed into your stone form. 
# While "armed" you can click it to cancel it. It will then reread this configuration note-card. 
# While you are transformed into werewolf or statue, you cannot cancel it. 
# You have to wait until you are once again in your flesh form. 

# triggermode can be seen, unseen, day, or night. 
# Set this the way you want it to work. 
# seen means that you will transform when someone one is looking at you.
# unseen means that you will transform when no one is looking at you.
# day means you will transform when the sun comes up (the mooon sets).
# night means you will transform when the sun goes down (the moon comes out). 
triggermode=day

# transform can be stone or were. Set this the way you want it to work. 
# This option gives the name of the folder whose contents you will transform to.  
# If you are using the stgargoyle folders, use stone or were
transforminto=were

# By default, this HUD uses the same folder as the Gargoyle and Were HUD, #RLV/~stgargoyle. 
# If you have already set that up, then you're good to go. 
# If you want this HUD to use a different folder, set the name here.
# You need to set up these folders: 
# #RLV/~stgargoyle/flesh
# #RLV/~stgargoyle/stone
# #RLV/~stgargoyle/were
rlvfolder=stgargoyle

# loglevel can be set to error, info, debug, or trace. 
# Only log messages of the set level or higher are displayed. 
# info is useful but not necessary.  When set  to error, only errors are displayed. 
# If something is going weird with the HUD, set this to info or debug; it will tell you a lot about what it's doing. 
# When reporting a bug, log information is useful. The log will be sent only to you; it will not spam everyone else. 
loglevel=debug 

# restrict can be on or off. This is usually on for stone, off for were.
# on means that a stone statue cannot move. You will strike a pose randomly chosen from the ones in the HUD.
restrict=off

# pose can be none, any, or a specific name. It sets your pose when you are stone. 
# If pose is none, then your AO will set your movements. 
# If pose is any, then one of the animations in this HUD will be chosen randomly for you.
# If pose is the name of a specific pose, then you will take on that animation. 
pose=any

# rlv can be on or off.  When on, and you are transformed, RLV restrictions are in place: 
# @chatshout=n,chatnormal=n,fly=n,tploc=n,tplure_sec=n,emote=add,sendchat=n
# @remattach=n,addattach=n,remoutfit=n,addoutfit=n,tploc=n
# @rez=n,showinv=n,fartouch=n,touchall=n,touchattach=n,touchworld=n

# You can set this on or off. This is usually on. 
rlv=on

# transform can be on or off.
# You can set this on or off. This is usually on. This is the main point of the HUD, right? 
transform=on

# plinth can be off or a location coded like region/128/128/20
# If it is set to a location, you will be teleported there when you transform. 
# You must set this to your own plinth location. 
# (If you're a werewolf, this could be inside your cage.) 
# If the sim contains a telehub, you will land there instead of the desired point.
plinth=Black Gazza/218/44/36
# plinthangle is degrees counterclockwise from north.
plinthrotation=0

# beetlejuice can be a phrase which, repeated three times will summon you if you are not on a plinth.
# When you hear someone say "<yourname> <yourname> <yourname>" you will teleport to them.
# If they are more than 20 meters away, they have to shout. 
# If they are more than 100 meters away, it won't work.
# If the region has a telehub, you will be sent there instead of near them.
beetlejuice=<yourname>

# The following options are for the day or night trigger mode.

# sunangle sets the duration you will be transformed.
# 0 is the horizon;  1 is the zenith or nadir. 
# If trigger mode is day, the sun must be at least this much higher than the horizon. 
# 0 would be sunrise and sunset. 
# .5 would be 9 am to 3 pm. 
# If trigger mode is night, the sun must be at least this much lower than the horizon. 
# 0 would be sunrise and sunset. 
# .5 would be 9 pm to 3 am. 
sunangle=0.1

# The following options are for the unseen mode. 

# seated can be on or off. Off means that seated avatars will not trigger you. 
# Having a statue or someone who's not moving trigger you to become a statue can be annoying. 
# SL can detect the relative angle of the prim the avatar is sitting on, but not the avatar. 
# That makes it difficult to reliably determine where the avatar is looking. 
# So statue transformations are rarely according to what you'd expect. 
# This is usually off. 
seated=off

# sensorradius sets how close someone must be to "see" you.
# Only people within this distance from you will trigger the HUD. 
# It's not very playable to have anyone in the SIM trigger your transformation. 
# A good value to start with is 10. 
sensorradius=10

# sensorrate is how often the sensor runs. 
# Sensors are a drain on sim resources and people don't move very fast, 
# so 2 seems to be a good compromise. 
sensorrate=2

# continuousLookThreshold is the number of sensor cycles that someone
# must have been looking at you for you to transform. 
# SL cannot instantaneously pop you back and forth between states
# the way it worked in the Dr. Who episodes, so this adds a bit of hysteresis. 
# With a sensorrate of 2 and a threshold of 4, that's about 8 seconds. 
# That means someone has to look at you (or not) for 8 seconds before you transform.
continuousLookThreshold=4

# angleThreshold is half the assumed field of view of an avatar, in radians. 
# If you are within that angle of the avatar's line of sight, the avatar can "see you" and you transform. 
# 0 is straight ahead; 3.1 (Pi) is behind them. .5 is about 30Â° to the left or right of them. 
# A smaller number means they have to be looking more accurately; 
# a larger number means more general direction. 
# A good value to start with is 0.5 
angleThreshold=0.5

# Presets:
# The following are examples of how to set up this HUD. 
# Uncomment all the settings lines in any of these sections. 

# Gargoyle:  During the day you transform into a statue. 
# triggermode=day
# transforminto=stone
# when=day
# howlong=3.0
# restrict=on
# rlv=on
# Optionally add a Plinth you return to. 

# Weeping Angel:
# When no one is looking, you transform into your Flesh form and can move about freely. 
# When someone looks at you, you transform into a statue and are frozen until they stop looking. 
# triggermode=seen
# transforminto=stone
# restrict=on
# rlv=on

# Werewolf: 
# During the day, you transform into your flesh form. 
# At night, you transform into your were form. 
# triggermode=night
# transforminto=were
# howlong=1.0
# restrict=off
# rlv=on

# Unseen Werewolf: 
# When someone looks at you, you transform into your flesh form. 
# When no one is looking at you, you transform into your were form. 
# triggermode=unseen
# transforminto=were
# restrict=off
# rlv=on

# Beetlejuice:
# When someone speaks your name three times wihtin your hearing,
# you are transported to them. 
# transform=off
# rlv=off 
# beetlejuice=Beetlejuice

# The initializer must fetch and process every line of this note card. 
# Once you have this set up, copy this for a backup, then edit to remove all # lines.
